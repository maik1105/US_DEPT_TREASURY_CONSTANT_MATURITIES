This project explores the dynamics of U.S. interest rates using historical Federal Reserve time series data. It applies deep learning techniques â€” specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks â€” to model and forecast key economic indicators such as the 10-Year Treasury Yield.

âœ… Cleaned and labeled 124 Federal Reserve series codes using custom parsing logic

ðŸ“Š Visualized historical trends and model predictions for selected rates

ðŸ§  Built and trained LSTM models to forecast interest rate movements
